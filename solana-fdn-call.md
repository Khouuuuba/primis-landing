## 🎙️ SCRIPT

### 1. INTRO & CONTEXT (2 min)

> "Thanks for taking the time. I'm [Name], founder of Primis Protocol.
>
> **Quick context:** We're building Solana-native AI infrastructure — specifically, a capital layer that makes AI compute cheaper while giving SOL holders a new yield source.
>
> I wanted to show you what we've built because I think it aligns well with where Solana is heading on AI. We have a working beta live on devnet right now."

---

### 2. THE PROBLEM (2 min)

> "Two problems we're solving:
>
> **For AI builders:**
> GPU compute is expensive. RunPod, Lambda Labs, cloud providers — they all charge full margin. Crypto-native teams also want to pay in crypto, not credit cards.
>
> **For capital providers:**
> SOL staking yields ~6-8%. That's fine, but the capital isn't *doing* anything beyond validating blocks. There's no exposure to growth sectors like AI.
>
> **The gap:** AI needs capital. Capital needs yield. No one is connecting them on Solana."

---

### 3. PRIMIS SOLUTION (3 min)

> "Primis creates a flywheel:
>
> 1. **Capital providers** deposit SOL into our staking vault
> 2. That capital subsidizes **AI compute** — we can offer 25-30% cheaper than competitors
> 3. Revenue from compute flows back to stakers as **additional yield**
>
> **The economics:**
> - We take 10% fee on compute volume
> - 50% of that goes to stakers
> - 50% to Primis (operations, growth)
>
> So stakers get: **base staking yield + compute revenue share**
>
> **Why Solana:**
> - Fast finality for real-time compute pricing
> - Low fees make micro-distributions viable
> - Native token staking is straightforward
> - Growing AI/DePIN narrative
>
> This only works on Solana. Ethereum's gas would eat the economics."

---

### 4. LIVE DEMO (5 min)

> "Let me show you the working beta."

**[Share screen — primisprotocol.ai/capitalprovider]**

> "This is our Capital Provider dashboard on devnet.
>
> **Stats Bar:** You can see:
> - TVL: ~14 SOL currently deposited
> - Staker Revenue: ~0.4 SOL distributed so far
> - Next Distribution: countdown to next yield cycle (every 10 min on devnet)
>
> **The Staking Flow:**
> - User connects Phantom wallet
> - Deposits SOL (minimum 1 SOL)
> - Transaction hits our on-chain program
> - They immediately start accruing yield
>
> **Variable APY:**
> - APY depends on your share of TVL
> - Early stakers get higher APY (smaller pool, same revenue)
> - As TVL grows, APY normalizes — this incentivizes early participation
>
> **Verification:**
> Everything is on-chain. I can show you the vault on Solscan — real transactions, real state."

**[Open Solscan if they want to verify]**

> "Program ID: `Bp4pmvckwNicvQrxafeCgrM35WnTE1qz2MbvGWA4GhDf`
>
> We've done 55+ yield distributions. All verifiable."

### 5. ROADMAP & VISION (3 min)

> "Where we are and where we're going:
>
> **Current (Devnet Beta):**
> - ✅ Staking vault on-chain
> - ✅ Yield distribution working
> - ✅ Capital Provider dashboard live
> - ✅ AI Builder demo with GPU provisioning
>
> **Next 3-6 months:**
> - Security audit
> - Mainnet launch
> - LST support (accept stSOL, mSOL, jitoSOL)
> - Scale compute volume with AI builder partnerships
>
> **12-month vision:**
> - $10M+ TVL
> - Real compute revenue flowing to stakers
> - Become the default capital layer for AI on Solana
>
> **Long-term:**
> - Expand to training workloads
> - Cross-chain compute (Solana as settlement layer)
> - Protocol-owned compute infrastructure"

---

### 6. ALIGNMENT WITH SOLANA (2 min)

> "I see Primis as infrastructure for Solana's AI narrative:
>
> **For the ecosystem:**
> - Gives SOL a new utility — not just staking, but powering AI
> - Attracts AI builders who want cheaper compute + crypto-native payments
> - Creates real revenue flows on-chain (not just speculation)
>
> **For Solana Foundation:**
> - We're building in public, on Solana, with a working product
> - We can help with AI builder onboarding (we're already talking to teams)
> - Happy to collaborate on content, events, grants if there's a fit
>
> **Differentiation:**
> - Not another GPU marketplace (we're not competing with Render/Akash)
> - Not a token-first project (no token yet, product-first)
> - Real economics, not ponzinomics"

---

### 7. ASK / DISCUSSION (3 min)

> "A few things I'd love your thoughts on:
>
> 1. **Feedback:** Does this align with what you're seeing in the AI space on Solana?
>
> 2. **Introductions:** Are there AI teams building on Solana we should talk to? We can offer cheaper compute.
>
> 3. **Grants/Support:** Is there a grants program or accelerator that might be a fit once we're closer to mainnet?
>
> 4. **Visibility:** Any opportunities to showcase Primis — Solana events, blog posts, ecosystem updates?
>
> Happy to go deeper on any of this."

## ❓ ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS

**Q: How do you source compute?**
> "We aggregate across RunPod, Vast.ai, Lambda Labs, and Together AI. Multi-provider routing for best price/availability. Eventually we'll add our own hardware."

**Q: What's your token plan?**
> "No token right now. We want to prove the economics work first. If we do a token, it would be for governance and protocol ownership — not to bootstrap fake TVL."

**Q: How do you compete with Render, Akash, io.net?**
> "Different model. They're supply-side (GPU providers). We're demand-side (AI builders) + capital-side (yield seekers). We're not asking people to run nodes. We're asking people to deposit capital and AI teams to use compute."

**Q: Security?**
> "Audit planned before mainnet. Currently on devnet for controlled testing. Program is upgradeable with authority multisig for now."

**Q: Team?**
> "[Adjust based on your actual team] Solo founder currently, but I've built the full stack — Solana program, backend, frontend, yield system. Looking to expand once we have product-market fit."

**Q: Revenue model?**
> "10% of compute volume. At $10M yearly compute, that's $1M revenue. Half to stakers, half to Primis. Scales with usage."

   - Ask for the application link / process

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

- [ ] They saw the working beta (proof of execution)
- [ ] They see alignment with Solana AI strategy
- [ ] There's a clear next step (intro, grant app, follow-up call)

---

## 💡 KEY MESSAGES TO LAND

1. **"We have a working product on devnet today."** — Most projects are vaporware. We're not.

2. **"This only works on Solana."** — Fast, cheap, native staking. Not portable to other chains.

3. **"We're product-first, not token-first."** — Building real infrastructure, not hype.

4. **"Capital + AI = flywheel."** — Simple, compelling model that benefits all sides.

*Good luck with the call! 🚀*
