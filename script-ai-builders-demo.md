# AI Builders Demo Video Script

**Platform:** Loom  
**Duration:** 2-3 minutes  
**Tone:** Technical, confident, forward-looking  
**Audience:** AI researchers, ML engineers, startup founders, VCs

## INTRO (15 seconds)

> "Hey everyone, I'm [Name] from Primis Protocol. Today I'm going to walk you through our AI Builders demo — a working prototype of how we're making GPU compute significantly cheaper by connecting it to DeFi yield."

## WHY BATCH IMAGE GENERATION (30 seconds)

> "For this demo, we chose batch image generation with Stable Diffusion XL. Here's why:
>
> First, it's **tangible**. You submit prompts, you get images back. There's no ambiguity — the compute either works or it doesn't.
>
> Second, it demonstrates **real GPU utilization**. Each image requires actual A100 inference cycles. We're not simulating anything here — these are real RunPod serverless GPUs processing your requests.
>
> And third, it shows **scale**. You can submit 10, 20, 50 prompts at once and watch them process in parallel. That's the kind of throughput AI teams actually need."

*[Screen: Show the batch submission form with multiple prompts]*

## THE PRIMIS ADVANTAGE - PRICING (30 seconds)

> "Now let's talk about why this matters economically.
>
> On standard cloud providers, SDXL inference costs around 4 to 6 cents per image. On Primis, we're at **1 cent per image** — that's 75% cheaper than market rates.
>
> The key insight is that **Primis doesn't need to profit from compute margins**. Our revenue model is different. Capital providers stake SOL, earn yield, and a portion of that yield subsidizes compute costs.
>
> This isn't a loss leader — it's a fundamentally different economic model. As our protocol grows, as more capital flows in, we can maintain these prices sustainably while still providing real yield to stakers."

## WORKFLOW WALKTHROUGH (45 seconds)

> "Let me show you the actual workflow.
>
> I'll enter a few prompts here — let's do a futuristic cityscape, a robot portrait, and some abstract art. The system automatically calculates the cost: 3 images at just 1 cent each, 3 cents total, estimated processing time under a minute.
>
> *[Click Generate]*
>
> The job is now in our queue. You can see it's moved to 'pending' — and when I click 'Start', it begins processing on real GPU infrastructure.
>
> *[Click Start, wait a moment]*
>
> Watch the progress bar. Each image is being generated by Stable Diffusion XL on A100 GPUs. This isn't a mock-up — these are actual inference requests hitting RunPod's serverless infrastructure.
>
> *[When complete, click View]*
>
> And here are the results. Full 1024x1024 images. I can view them in the lightbox, download individually, or grab all of them at once."

## DASHBOARD OVERVIEW (20 seconds)

> "Quick look at the broader dashboard:
>
> We've got the **Usage tab** showing your credit balance, transaction history, and this month's spending.
>
> The **GPU Marketplace** shows real-time availability across instance types — RTX 4090s, A100s, H100s — all with Primis-subsidized pricing visible against market rates.
>
> Everything syncs with our backend, which is connected to both Stripe for payments and RunPod for GPU provisioning."

*[Screen: Quick pan across Usage tab, then GPU Marketplace]*

## WHAT'S NEXT (20 seconds)

> "This is our MVP — and it's fully functional today. You can sign up, buy credits, and run real GPU workloads.
>
> On the roadmap: **API keys for programmatic access**, so you can integrate Primis into your training pipelines. **Multiple GPU providers** for better availability. And **per-second billing** for maximum efficiency.
>
> In our **next demo video**, I'll walk through the **Capital Allocator side** — how staking works, how yield is calculated, and how the economics connect these two sides of the protocol."

*[Screen: Back to dashboard overview]*

## CLOSING (15 seconds)

> "Primis is building the infrastructure layer that makes AI compute economically sustainable — for builders who need cheaper GPUs, and for capital providers who want productive yield.
>
> If you're an AI team burning through cloud credits, or a capital allocator looking for real yield backed by real demand — we'd love to talk.
>
> Links in the description. Thanks for watching."

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Screens to Capture
1. Dashboard overview (logged in state)
2. Batch tab with empty state
3. Template selector showing $0.01/image
4. Prompt textarea with 3-4 example prompts
5. Cost estimate box
6. Job list showing "pending" state
7. Job processing with progress bar
8. Completed job with "View" button
9. Image gallery modal
10. Lightbox with single image
11. Usage tab with balance and history
12. GPU Marketplace tab

### Key Numbers to Emphasize
- $0.01 per image (vs $0.04-0.06 market) — 75%+ cheaper
- 20-30% target discount at scale
- Real A100 GPUs
- 1024x1024 resolution
- ~15-20 seconds per image

### Tone Guidelines
- Confident but not arrogant
- Technical but accessible
- Focus on "real" and "working" — this isn't vaporware
- Forward-looking without overpromising
- Emphasize the economic innovation, not just the tech

### Teaser for Next Video
The Capital Allocator demo should generate curiosity:
- "How does staking SOL translate to cheaper GPUs?"
- "What yield rates are we talking about?"
- "How does the 70/20/10 split actually work?"
