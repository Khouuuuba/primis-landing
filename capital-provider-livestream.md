## 🎙️ INTRO (2-3 minutes)

### Opening Hook
> "GM everyone! Today is a big day for Primis Protocol. We're officially launching our **Devnet Beta** — and you can try it right now."

### What We're Announcing
> "For the first time, you can:
> - Connect your wallet
> - Deposit devnet SOL
> - Start earning yield from AI compute demand
> 
> No waitlist. No signup. Just connect and deposit."

### Quick Context
> "If you're new here — Primis is building Solana-native AI infrastructure. We're creating a flywheel where:
> - **Capital providers** (that's you) deposit SOL
> - That capital powers **cheaper AI compute** for builders
> - Revenue from compute flows back to **you as yield**
> 
> Think of it as: your SOL doesn't just sit there staking — it's actively fueling the AI economy."

## 📊 DEMO: THE DASHBOARD (5-7 minutes)

### Show the Landing Page First
> "Let me start at primisprotocol.ai — you'll notice the announcement bar at the top. 'Devnet Beta is Live.' Click it or go to the Capital Provider section."

### Connect Wallet
> "I'm going to connect my Phantom wallet. Make sure you're on **Devnet** — this is test SOL, not real money."

*[Connect wallet on stream]*

### Dashboard Overview
> "Once connected, you see your personalized dashboard:
> 
> **Stats Bar at the top:**
> - TVL (Total Value Locked) — currently around 14 SOL
> - Staker Revenue — how much has been distributed to stakers
> - Next Distribution countdown — yield distributes every 10 minutes
> 
> **Your Earnings card:**
> - Claimable yield — what you can claim right now
> - Total earned — your lifetime earnings"

## 💰 HOW THE APY WORKS (4-5 minutes)

### The Variable APY Model
> "Here's where it gets interesting. Your APY is **variable** — it depends on your share of the TVL."

### Show the APY Comparison Card
> "Look at this APY card. It shows:
> - Regular Solana staking: ~6%
> - Your Primis APY: this changes based on your stake percentage
> 
> **Why is the APY so high right now?**
> 
> Simple math: We're simulating $10M yearly compute volume. 10% goes to Primis as a fee. 50% of that fee goes to stakers. That's $500K/year to the staker pool.
> 
> If the TVL is only 14 SOL (~$2,100), and you own 70% of it... you're getting 70% of $500K. That's insane APY.
> 
> **Early staker advantage.** As more people deposit, your share decreases, APY normalizes. This is the window."

### The Formula
> "Your APY = (Your Stake / Total TVL) × Yearly Staker Pool
> 
> - More you stake → higher share → higher APY
> - More TVL grows → lower share → APY normalizes
> - More compute volume → bigger pool → everyone wins"

## ⚙️ HOW STAKING WORKS (3-4 minutes)

### Deposit Flow
> "Let me deposit some SOL to show you how it works."

*[Click Deposit button]*

> "Minimum is now **1 SOL** — we lowered it from 10 SOL for the beta.
> 
> I'll deposit 5 SOL. Click confirm in my wallet..."

*[Execute transaction]*

> "That's it. Transaction confirmed on Solana devnet. My stake is now active.
> 
> Notice:
> - Dashboard updates instantly
> - My APY recalculates based on my new stake percentage
> - I start earning from the next distribution cycle"

### Yield Distribution
> "Every 10 minutes, the protocol distributes yield. You'll see:
> - Your claimable balance increase
> - The 'Staker Revenue' in the stats bar tick up
> 
> This is **real on-chain** — not simulated UI. You can verify every transaction on Solscan."

### Claiming Yield
> "When you want to withdraw your earnings, hit 'Claim Yield'. SOL goes straight to your wallet."

## 🔮 THE VISION (3-4 minutes)

### What We're Building
> "This devnet beta is step one. Here's the bigger picture:
> 
> **Phase 1 (Now):** Prove the model works. You deposit, you earn, you claim. Simple.
> 
> **Phase 2:** Launch on mainnet with real yield from real AI compute.
> 
> **Phase 3:** Scale compute volume. More AI builders → more revenue → better yields.
> 
> **The Endgame:** Primis becomes the default capital layer for AI on Solana. Your SOL earns base staking yield PLUS compute revenue. Two income streams, one deposit."

### Why This Matters
> "Traditional staking: 6-8% APY, done.
> 
> Primis: Base yield + revenue share from a growing AI economy.
> 
> We're not competing with validators. We're adding a new yield source on top.
> 
> And because it's on Solana — fast, cheap, composable — we can do things other chains can't."

## 🎯 CALL TO ACTION (1-2 minutes)

### Try It Now
> "Here's what I want you to do:
> 
> 1. Go to **primisprotocol.ai/capitalprovider**
> 2. Connect your wallet (make sure you're on devnet)
> 3. Get devnet SOL from a faucet if you need it
> 4. Deposit at least 1 SOL
> 5. Watch your yield accumulate
> 
> It's live. It's real. It's on-chain."

### Follow Along
> "We're building in public. Follow @primisprotocol on X for updates.
> 
> If you're an **AI builder** looking for cheaper compute — DM us. We're onboarding teams."

### Closing
> "This is day one of the Primis economy. The earlier you're in, the bigger your share.
> 
> Thanks for watching. Let's build."

## ❓ Q&A PROMPTS

If people ask questions, here are answers:

**Q: Is this real money?**
> "No, this is devnet — test SOL only. Mainnet coming soon."

**Q: What's the minimum deposit?**
> "1 SOL on devnet."

**Q: How often is yield distributed?**
> "Every 10 minutes on devnet. Mainnet will likely be daily or per-epoch."

**Q: Where does the yield come from?**
> "From AI compute fees. Primis takes 10% of compute volume, splits it 50/50 with stakers."

**Q: When mainnet?**
> "After we validate the model on devnet and complete security audits. Follow us for updates."

**Q: Is my SOL locked?**
> "No. You can withdraw anytime. Fully liquid."

**Q: Why is APY so high?**
> "Early staker advantage. Low TVL + fixed revenue pool = high APY per person. As TVL grows, APY normalizes."
