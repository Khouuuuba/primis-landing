# M1.1 Sprint Summary: Docker Validation & Resource Profiling

> **Sprint**: M1.1  
> **Status**: ✅ Complete (Documentation Phase)  
> **Date**: January 31, 2026

---

## 🎯 Sprint Objectives

| Objective | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Analyze Moltbot Docker requirements | ✅ Complete | Node 22, 2GB RAM, pnpm |
| Find/validate Docker image | ✅ Complete | No public image - need to build |
| Test deployment on RunPod | ❌ Cancelled | RunPod requires GPU (~$100/mo) |
| Identify alternative hosting | ✅ Complete | Railway recommended |
| Create deployment template | ✅ Complete | Railway template created |
| Cost analysis | ✅ Complete | $10-15/mo per instance |

---

## 🔑 Key Findings

### 1. No Public Moltbot Docker Image

Moltbot does **not** publish a pre-built Docker image. Deployments must build from source.

**Impact**: We need to either:
- Build and host our own image (GitHub Actions)
- Use platforms that build from Dockerfile (Railway, Fly.io)

**Decision**: Use Railway (builds from Dockerfile directly)

---

### 2. RunPod is Too Expensive for CPU Workloads

RunPod is designed for GPU workloads. CPU-only containers still require renting a GPU.

| Provider | Moltbot Cost/mo | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| RunPod (cheapest GPU) | ~$100+ | ❌ Overkill |
| Railway | ~$10-15 | ✅ Perfect fit |
| Fly.io | ~$14-20 | ✅ Good alternative |

**Decision**: Use Railway for MVP. Same infrastructure as our backend.

---

### 3. Moltbot Resource Requirements

From official `fly.toml` and Dockerfile:

| Resource | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Node.js | v22+ (strict requirement) |
| Package Manager | pnpm (not npm) |
| Build Tool | Bun (for build scripts) |
| RAM | 2GB minimum |
| CPU | 2 shared vCPUs |
| Storage | Persistent volume for /data |
| Ports | 3000 (gateway), 22 (SSH optional) |

---

### 4. Pricing Model Validated

At **$30/mo** user price with **~$10-15/mo** infrastructure cost:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Infrastructure Cost | ~$12/mo average |
| Price to User | $30/mo |
| Gross Margin | **~60%** |
| Breakeven Users | 1 |

**Conclusion**: Pricing model is viable.

## 📁 Deliverables

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `M1.1-docker-validation.md` | Full technical analysis |
| `railway-moltbot-template/` | Railway deployment template |
| `railway-moltbot-template/Dockerfile` | Custom Dockerfile |
| `railway-moltbot-template/railway.toml` | Railway config |
| `github-actions/build-moltbot-image.yml` | GH Actions for Docker builds |
| `../backend/scripts/test-moltbot-deploy.js` | RunPod test script (reference) |

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (M1.2)

Based on M1.1 findings, here's the adjusted plan for M1.2:

### M1.2: Backend Integration (Railway)

1. **Railway API integration** - Provision services programmatically
2. **Database schema** - Store Moltbot instances
3. **Secrets management** - Encrypt/store user API keys
4. **Health monitoring** - Track instance status
5. **Billing webhook** - Stripe subscription integration

### Required Before M1.2:

- [ ] Railway account with API access
- [ ] Test the Railway template manually
- [ ] Verify environment variables work

---

## ⚠️ Risks Identified

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Moltbot breaking changes | Pin to specific commits/versions |
| Railway API limitations | Have Fly.io as backup |
| Build time (~5-10 min) | Pre-build and cache images |
| User abandonment | 7-day trial before charging |

---

## ✅ Sprint M1.1 Complete

**Summary**: We validated that Moltbot can be deployed cost-effectively using Railway at ~$10-15/mo, enabling a profitable $30/mo pricing model. RunPod is not suitable due to GPU requirements. Technical requirements are well-documented and a deployment template is ready.

**Next**: M1.2 - Backend Integration (Create API to provision Railway services)
